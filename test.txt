Best option (for your app now)

wger is the strongest fit: it has exercises, muscles, equipment, and media endpoints.
Useful endpoints: /api/v2/exerciseinfo/, /api/v2/exercise/, /api/v2/exerciseimage/, /api/v2/muscle/, /api/v2/equipment/.
From Context7/docs, exerciseinfo includes images, and muscle objects include image fields (e.g. image_url_main).
Other options

ExerciseDB has large exercise coverage and includes media fields like imageUrl/videoUrl, plus muscles/equipment metadata.
API Ninjas has good text metadata, but it does not appear to provide exercise image assets directly.
